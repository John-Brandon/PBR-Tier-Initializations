# First code repository 
At this stage, we have connected the pipes. This repository includes preliminary FORTRAN code. The code is being developed in the FORTRAN 90/95 language. I'm working under Mac OS 10.9.5 and using the *gfortran* 4.9.1 compiler (free, open source, GNU Fortran 95 compiler). No punch-cards were harmed during this exercise. 

# Status of code development
Currently in progress, building modules for population dynamics model.
