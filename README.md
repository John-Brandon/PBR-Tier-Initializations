PBR-Tier-System
===============

# General notes
This repository includes preliminary FORTRAN code. The code is being developed in the FORTRAN 90/95 language, working under Mac OS 10.9.5 and using [the *gfortran* 4.2 compiler (free, open source, GNU Fortran 95 compiler)](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran). 

The code that is being developed is currently located in the `PBR Netbeans` folder; it is being developed using the Netbeans 8.0 integrated development environment (IDE), which produces the associated make files in that directory.  

# Status of code development
The two-stock operating model is nearly complete. There is also R code being developed for reading output files and creating plots, but I haven't added that code to this repository (yet)...
