PBR-Tier-System
===============

# General notes
This repository includes preliminary FORTRAN code. The code is being developed in the FORTRAN 90/95 language, working under Mac OS 10.9.5 and using [the *gfortran* 4.9.1 compiler (free, open source, GNU Fortran 95 compiler)](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran). 

The code that is being developed is currently located in the `PBR Netbeans` folder. This code is being developed in the Netbeans 8.0 integrated development environment (IDE), which produces the associated make files in that directory.  

# Status of code development
Currently in progress, building modules for population dynamics model. The repository is in its infancy, but under active development.
