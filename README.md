# 'Forked' version of PBR-Tier-System Repo

Working on initialization of population age structure with Andre Punt. Cloned the original repo, and pushed that into this repo (apparently it's not possible to fork your own repo on github, so this is something of a hack). 

The objective of this repo is to provide a safe copy of the code base, in case I break something when fiddling around and running checks with Andre.
