PBR-Tier-System
===============

# General notes
At this stage, we have connected the pipes. This repository includes preliminary FORTRAN code. The code is being developed in the FORTRAN 90/95 language. I'm working under Mac OS 10.9.5 and using the *gfortran* 4.9.1 compiler (free, open source, GNU Fortran 95 compiler). No punch-cards were harmed during this exercise. 

The code that is being developed is currently located in the PBR Netbeans folder. This code is being developed in the Netbeans 8.0 integrated development environment (IDE), which produces the associated make files in that directory.  

# Status of code development
Currently in progress, building modules for population dynamics model. The repository is in its infancy, but under active development. Watch this space.
